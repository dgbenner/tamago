# Tamago build log

Kept under _source/autonomous-build.md. Newest phase first.

## Phase 2a: Units 2 to 5, the learning tree, home screen (November 9, 2026)

**Built**

- Import reads workbook v8 (v7 at the start of the phase) and checks tree_layout. Content outside the workbook (decisions, Tatoeba pulls in content/pull, drafts in content/drafts.json) is merged at import and skipped once the workbook holds it.
- Wiktionary check: handles pages split into subpages ("a"), sense picks for the 64 new words in content/word-senses.json.
- scripts/pull-units.mjs: content_pull rules P01 to P09, report in content/pull/review.md.
- scripts/workbook-sync.mjs: folds everything back into the next workbook version, with a README changelog row. v8 written and verified: rebuilding from v8 alone gives the same app content.
- Lesson engine: contentForUnit (own sentences plus borrowed ones, words of this and earlier units, QT09 answers from any unit). Progress, rounds seen and the next-lesson carry are per unit; review spans all units.
- Home: the tree (rows, nodes with an icon slot, five round segments, the current unit's round and lesson), unit cards, locked units, pinned Review and Continue or Resume.

**Decisions**

- Followed Dan's Phase 2a rulings: cuts, U02 words, 4 QT09 pairs per unit, drafts to reach 3 per word, U03 borrows U01's tu/es sentences, five short hints.
- Approved U02 myself under the brief (the newer instruction): 53 sentences, every word in 3 or more.
- The pull's extra rules (names, digits, articles, noun meaning, plainest English) and why: the first pull let in places, star signs and pronoun uses of le that would teach the wrong thing.
- Hints for words without one: Wiktionary's gloss, or for a verb form "to eat (manger)". hint_source says Wiktionary.
- Node icon slot shows the unit number until unit icons exist.
- Starting another unit while a lesson is in progress sets the lesson aside, and the card says so.

**Stubbed**

- Grammar note button on the unit card (Phase 2b).

**Waiting for Dan**

- Reading the new units; the native-speaker check list (102 sentences); hosting move off Netlify.
